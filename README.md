## Real Data Sets Used

These visualizations were inspired by and based on publicly available data from the **Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA)**:

- ðŸ”— [Labor Force Survey - Labor Force, Employment and Unemployment](https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__1B__LFS/0011B3ALFS0.px/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=227f6805-9732-41b6-981c-ac178832d6db)
- ðŸ”— [Monthly Farmgate Prices - Palay and Corn](https://openstat.psa.gov.ph/PXWeb/pxweb/en/DB/DB__2M__NFG/0032M4AFN01.px/table/tableViewLayout1/?rxid=bda60f7d-c6e3-4ead-b481-546544129edf)

These datasets provide the foundation for the employment rate, unemployment rate, and agricultural commodity price trends across various years and months.
